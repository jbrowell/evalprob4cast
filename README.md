## Data format requirements

The tools inside IEAwind51RP expects a certain data structure. The data must be organized as a list of 2 members, called exactly `forecasts` and `observations`. The `forecasts` member may then consist of any number of data frames, where one data frame represents the time series generated by one forecast candidate. The first column of a forecast data table must be named `TimeStamp`. If applicable, the second column may hold the timestamps at which the forecasts were issued, which must then be named `BaseTime`. Every other column represents the time series of an ensemble member, and they are not restricted to any specific naming rules. Insert example data.

The `observations` member is just one and only one data frame. The first column contains the observation timestamps and must be named `TimeStamp`; the second column contains the observed values and must be named `obs`.

The package comes with a helper function, `load_forecast_data()`, intended for users that prefer to store their forecasts and observations in individual csv-files.
