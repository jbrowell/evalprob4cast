## Guidance for contributors

## Data format requirements

The tools inside IEAwind51RP expects a certain data structure. The data must be organized as a list of 2 members, called exactly "forecasts" and "observations". The "forecasts" member may then consist of any number of data frames, where one data frame represents the time series generated by one forecast candidate. The first column of a forecast data table must be named "TimeStamp". If applicable, the second column may hold the timestamps at which the forecasts were issued, which must then be named "BaseTime". Every other column represents the time series of an ensemble member, and they are not restricted to any specific naming rules. Insert example data.

The "observations" member is just one and only one data frame. The first column contains the observation timestamps and must be named "TimeStamp"; the second column contains the observed values and must be named "obs".

The package comes with a helper function, load_forecast_data(), intended for users that prefer to store their forecasts and observations in individual csv-files.
